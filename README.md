## Introduction

> Twitterâ€™s early promise as a political tool has become ingrained as a political reality... The amount of discursive access to politicians is unprecedented in the past century of American politics.
_(Vann R. Newkirk II, "The American Idea in 140 Characters", 2016)_

It's common knowledge that Twitter is a popular choice for those who wish to voice their opinions on a variety of subjects -- especially politics. Therefore, if we mine tweets for the sentiment surrounding important elections, can we predict what candidate will win the election? Or, how many votes each candidate will receive?

## Objective

The goal of this project is to predict U.S. presidential candidate sentiment on a state-by-state basis by tweet data.
